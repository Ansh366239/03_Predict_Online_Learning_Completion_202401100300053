## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Exploration & Visualization**
   - Checked nulls, distributions, and target balance
   - Visualized course completion rates

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Standardized numerical features

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

4. **Evaluation**
   - Visualized confusion matrix and feature importance
   - Measured accuracy and performance metrics
